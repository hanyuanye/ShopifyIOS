# ShopifyIOS

There's haptic feedback for most of the actions(I always wanted to try implementing it and it was surprisingly easy).

Other than that, pretty standard implementation of a CollectionView with some networking. If I were to add stuff to it, I'd probably add a 
error alerts for if things failed to download, and perhaps a user flow if something didn't load in.
